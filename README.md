** Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing the famous Titanic dataset, which contains passenger information from the RMS Titanic disaster of 1912.
The analysis aims to uncover patterns and factors that influenced passenger survival using data analysis techniques.

**Objective**

The main objectives of this project are:

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Explore passenger data using statistical analysis

Identify factors affecting survival

Generate meaningful insights through visualization

**Dataset Description**

The dataset includes passenger-related features such as:

PassengerId – Unique identifier

Pclass – Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

Name – Passenger name

Sex – Gender

Age – Age of passenger

SibSp – Siblings / spouses aboard

Parch – Parents / children aboard

Fare – Ticket fare

Embarked – Port of embarkation

Survived – Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

_ Steps Performed_
_ Data Import_

The dataset was loaded from a CSV/Excel file using Pandas.

** Data Cleaning**

Handled missing values (Age, Embarked, Cabin)

Checked data types and structure

Removed or transformed unnecessary data

** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Analyzed relationships between survival and:

Gender

Passenger class

Age

Fare

Family size

** Visualization**

Created charts to better understand patterns and trends.

** Key Insights**

Female passengers had higher survival rates

First-class passengers were more likely to survive

Children had better survival chances

Higher fare correlated with higher survival probability

** Conclusion**

The analysis highlights how demographic and socio-economic factors influenced survival outcomes.
This project demonstrates the importance of data cleaning, exploration, and visualization in extracting meaningful insights.
